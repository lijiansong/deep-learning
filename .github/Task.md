## Cambricon
- [ ] TODO: research tensorflow compiler XLA, pay attention to its architecture, JIT and llvm (deadline 07/21)
- [ ] TODO: research faster-rcnn, pay attention to its algorithm (deadline 07/21)
- [ ] TODO: build clang & llvm on cambricon server and learn to write a backend for a novel hardware(deadline 07/20)
- [ ] TODO: find out research direction `deep learning programming language or compilier system`, focus on deep learning from the perspective of compilation tech, not deep learning platform e.g. tensorflow, caffe, pytorch and etc (dealine weekends).
- [ ] TODO: learn to write a simple assembler and linker, and try to modify the front-end of clang to support novel syntax feature.
- [ ] TODO: document research result xla compilier(dealine weekends).
